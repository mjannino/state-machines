# State Machines

## A demonstration project for examining usefulness of state machine libraries in python.

### How do I get this working?

You need docker + docker-compose.

1. Clone repo
2. `make build`
3. `make start`
4. `make app.shell` then `python main.py`
5. In the prompt `Library:` enter the library to demonstrate (from `python-statemachine`, `transitions`, and `automat`)
